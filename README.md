<h1>Drawingbot Morse Code Library For Use with Arduino and Servo</h1>

<p>This is a library for generating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code">Morse code</a> for a specified letter. It uses a servo library to control a pen attached to a servo on a drawing bot</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>See "Contributed Libraries" on <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Libraries">arduino.cc Libraries reference</a>. Briefly, place these files in a <code>morse</code> subdirectory in your sketchbook directory. You will also need to have the servo library installed as well.</p>

<h2>Character Support</h2>

<p>All uppercase letters are supported</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>This was written to be used with a WiFi enabled robot that has had a pen and servo mount added to it to enable it to draw. The pen is securely attached to the servo and as the robot moves forward the morse code corresponding to the characters inputted will be drawn out.</p>
